# Dispositif cognitif LLM-Humain

**Research on LLM-human collaboration as cognitive amplification rather than automation.**

This repository documents real-world thought processes when using LLMs as cognitive exoskeletons. Focus on friction points, decision arbitration, and emergent dynamics rather than outputs. Challenges educational standardization and explores how human cognition evolves when AI becomes persistent collaborator.

**Status**: Ongoing exploration. No finalized method, by design. Each segment is a cognitive artifact revealing process, not product.
